## Arm E & F

HER2, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is a protein overexpressed in 15-20% of breast cancers. This overexpression is linked to aggressive cancer behavior, higher recurrence rates, and poorer survival outcomes. Targeting HER2 with therapies like Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab has transformed the treatment landscape, as these drugs not only block HER2 signaling but also harness the immune system to attack cancer cells. Despite the significant benefits of these therapies, resistance to treatment still occurs, and ongoing research is focused on understanding and overcoming this challenge.

The PETREMAC trial stratifies HER2-positive breast cancer patients based on TP53 mutation status. After a biopsy and genetic analysis, patients are assigned to either Arm E (TP53 wild-type) or Arm F (TP53 mutated). In Arm E, patients receive a combination of Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Docetaxel. Those in Arm F, with TP53 mutations, receive an additional drug, Cyclophosphamide. After 10 weeks of primary treatment, tumor response is evaluated. If resistance is detected, patients move to secondary treatment with Epirubicin and undergo further biopsies to monitor response and resistance mechanisms.

-   This slide highlights the research methodology used in the project, leveraging advanced genomic tools and biobanks. Whole Genome Sequencing and Transcriptome Sequencing are employed to track mutations and gene expression across different timepoints in therapy. Our biobanks, derived from clinical trials such as PETREMAC and DDP, provide crucial pre- and post-treatment biopsies for this analysis. Furthermore, immunohistochemical techniques are used to analyze the presence and dynamics of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, focusing on key players like TILs and macrophages. These approaches enable a comprehensive understanding of both tumor evolution and immune system interactions during treatment.

## Neoantigens

![](images/clipboard-2155123520.png)

This slide delves into the role of neoantigens, which are tumor-specific antigens formed by mutations. These neoantigens can provoke the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells, making them a critical factor in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-Her2 therapies. Tumors with a higher neoantigen load may have better responses to these therapies, as neoantigens act as flags that attract immune cells. Understanding the presence and role of neoantigens in tumors can lead to improved predictions of therapy outcomes and personalized treatment plans for patients with Her2-positive breast cancer.

## design of the PETREMAC trial

## ![](images/clipboard-3927802335.png)

This slide outlines the design of the PETREMAC trial, focusing on its use of dual anti-Her2 therapy with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab. The trial enrolled 60 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, providing a comprehensive biobank for studying treatment efficacy. With a strong focus on personalized medicine, biopsies collected before and after treatment allow researchers to study the evolution of tumors and the immune response. The trial saw a notable 48.3% of patients achieving a pathological complete response, a key marker of long-term survival. These findings serve as a foundation for deeper analyses of treatment resistance and sensitivity.

This slide highlights two key anti-HER2 drugs, Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab, and their mechanisms of action in treating HER2-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab blocks the HER2 receptor, preventing downstream signaling that promotes tumor growth. Additionally, it stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Pertuzumab complements this action by preventing HER2 from dimerizing with other HER receptors, further blocking tumor proliferation. Together, these drugs inhibit cancer cell growth while simultaneously engaging the immune system for a comprehensive anti-tumor response.

## ADCC

![](images/clipboard-2415977912.png)

Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) plays a vital role in the efficacy of anti-Her2 therapies like Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab. These antibodies bind to HER2 receptors on cancer cells, acting as a signal for immune cells like NK cells and macrophages to engage. Once bound, NK cells release toxic substances that kill the cancer cells, while macrophages engulf and digest them. This immune-driven mechanism amplifies the direct blocking of HER2 signaling, making ADCC a critical component of successful cancer treatment with these drugs.

-   **Role of pertuzumab**: Pertuzumab binds a different epitope of Her2, preventing dimerization with other HER family receptors, thereby inhibiting further signaling.

-   **Synergy of dual-drug therapy**: The combined use of trastuzumab and pertuzumab enhances the blockade of the Her2 pathway and amplifies the immune response by attracting cytotoxic immune cells.

### Section 2: Investigating Predictive Markers and Tumor Evolution

##### Page 2.1: PETREMAC Trial Design

-   **Overview of the PETREMAC trial**: PETREMAC is a neoadjuvant clinical trial that tests the effectiveness of dual anti-Her2 therapy (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) in combination with chemotherapy in Her2-positive breast cancer.

-   **Design and patient selection**: Patients with Her2-positive tumors were enrolled, with biopsies collected at multiple time points (pre-, during, and post-therapy) for detailed molecular analysis.

-   **Longitudinal sampling**: The study design enables real-time tracking of tumor evolution, clonal changes, and immune responses during therapy, offering unique insights into treatment dynamics.

##### Page 2.2: Subclonal Tumor Dynamics During Anti-Her2 Therapy

-   **Clonal evolution under therapy pressure**: Anti-Her2 therapy can drive the evolution of tumors by eradicating immunogenic subclones while allowing immune-privileged subclones to persist.

-   **Tracking subclonal changes**: Whole-genome sequencing of pre- and post-treatment biopsies from PETREMAC helps in identifying which subclones are resistant or sensitive to therapy.

-   **Role of neoantigens in clonal selection**: Subclones harboring neoantigens are often targeted and eliminated by immune responses, while those without neoantigens may evade immune detection.

##### Page 2.3: Spatial Profiling of Tumor and Immune Cells

-   **Introduction to spatial profiling**: Spatial profiling refers to the detailed mapping of the spatial distribution of tumor and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment.

-   **Spatial relationships between immune and cancer cells**: Understanding the localization of immune cells relative to tumor cells helps in identifying how therapies, like anti-Her2 drugs, recruit immune cells to specific tumor regions.
